# Lovanish

Lovanish is a improved version of the vanish function used in EssentialsX that makes a player dissapear.
The /lovanish command will make the player dissapear and the log out message will also pop up.

It's meant as a tool for mods to use to keep an eye on their players for bad behaviours.
There is also a blacklist function which works if the /lovanish effect should not affect you.
This is beneficial for streamers that does not want to show people this effect.
